#Chapter 3: Program Statements

##Overview

This chapter deals with program structure and control.  As a part of this chapter you should become familiar with both decision and looping structures and the process of decomposing a problem to decide where these structures are necessary.  Also you need to be able to recognize situations where loops and decision structures are necessary.
